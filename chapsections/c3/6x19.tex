“Mayhap ye need more carrot and less stick.”\\

“A wilted plant cruelly watered. Mayhap.”\\

Zealot Eóghainn shifts around on his seat, and points at his mouth.\\

“Stick yer hand down my throat. Don’t quarrel with me. Do as I say.”\\

Eóghainn grasps you by the wrist and opens wide. The old man is missing a number of teeth. Those that remain are crooked and jagged like an old graveyard.\\

Your hand plunges into his esophagus, and he releases your wrist. When you yank your hand back, he gives two heaves and then spits up bile. A metal ping hits the flagstones along with his vomit.\\

“There... \emph{haa...} there ye go, champion. May it serve ye well in future trials. Keh heh heh.”\\
