The gate swings open with a lilting whine that reverberates throughout the stone passage like a badly played orchestra of strings.\\

Just past the stairs' final curve, you encounter yet another barrier of fog filling the landing's entryway. Beyond its opaque grayness you can make out the sound of waves lapping and... something else. It's a noise reminiscent of labored breathing--but those lungs would have to be the size of cauldrons.\\

A foreboding feeling washes over you--heavy and suffocating. Chills wind their way down your spine and up again. Whatever threat lies beyond this fog, it will take the strength of the gathered Everloyal to overcome it.\\

But do they even possess the will to try?\\
