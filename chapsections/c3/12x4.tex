On a passing whim, you flip through some of the guards’ documents. Most of it looks uninteresting. Records and time tables. Some notes on certain prisoners and the circumstances of their capture. It looks like they made an attempt at serializing your kin, but gave up soon after.\\

You stop when you find a page with the Sign scribbled onto it. Notes are jotted along its margins. Hypotheses as to its symbology?\\

Your blood runs cold when you turn the page over. It’s the Keys. \emph{They were writing the Keys}.\\

You grab at a handful of papers and fling them to the floor. It must have been torture. They were wringing the Mystic Keys out of your kin like a wet washcloth--learning the words and parables--deciphering His secrets--\emph{writing them down.}\\

Your feet slip on the discarded papers, and you brace yourself against a desk. Your wrists. The bruises. The strappado. Surely it wasn’t you? You would never have talked. Did you?\\

There is only one solution to this.\\
