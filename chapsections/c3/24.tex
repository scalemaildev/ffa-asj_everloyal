Vast swathes of the block's upper floor are gone. The remaining section is perched perilously on a ribcage of support columns. A peninsula of flagstone tiles extends to the summit of the block's lone, surviving stairwell.\\

Gazing up the length of the stairwell, you reckon it's about as safe as anything else in this forsaken place. You start to climb, finding yourself buffeted with gusts of chill wind through the many gaps in the stairwell's circular wall. But the stairs themselves are still sturdy, and so you continue your ascent.\\

"And who are ye to strive to such great heights?"\\

A man watches you from the remnants of the upper floor. He is dressed in a prisoner's rags, but stands with a posture that implies his station in life was great before his imprisonment.\\

"I know ye. And ye could once say the like, but I reckon by the dark in yer eyes ye know me no more."\\

"Well. We'll test the steel beneath yer rust. Like as not we'll have much need of it."\\

"Come and see. Come and see."\\

And with that, the man turns and disappears deeper into the wreckage overhead. At the summit of the stairwell, you find that the archway is filled with a sheet of fog.\\
