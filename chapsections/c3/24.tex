Vast swathes of the upper floor are gone. What remains is perched perilously on a ribcage of support columns. A peninsula of flagstone tiles extends to the summit of the block's lone, surviving stairwell.\\

Gazing up the length of the stairwell, you reckon it's about as safe as anything else in this forsaken place. You start to climb, finding yourself buffeted with gusts of chill wind through the many gaps in the stairwell's circular wall. But the stairs themselves are still sturdy, and so you continue your ascent.\\

"And who are ye to strive to such great heights?!"\\

Turning around, you discover that a man is watching you from the remnants of the upper floor. At this distance, you can only see that he is dressed in a prisoner's rags. But he stands with a posture that implies his station in life is great.\\

"Come and see. Come and see."\\

And with that, he turns around and strolls off.\\
