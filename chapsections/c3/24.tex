Vast sections of the level overhead are gone. The remaining swathe is perched perilously on a ribcage of support columns. A peninsula of flagstone extends to the summit of the block’s lone, surviving stairwell.\\

This stairwell stands teetering on the mezzanine’s jagged precipice. Sections of its circular wall have dropped away, revealing glimpses of the winding staircase within. Gazing up the length of it, you reckon it’s about as safe as anything else in this forsaken place.\\

You begin your ascent, testing its fickle steps while buffeted by gusts of chill wind.\\

“And who are ye to strive to such great heights?”\\

A man watches you from the remnants of the upper floor. He is dressed in rags, but stands with a posture that implies his station in life was great once.\\

“I know ye. And ye could once say the like, but I reckon by the dark in yer eyes that ye know me no longer. Like a babe, ye are. A blind and foolish bairn. But mayhap yer hands still hold what yer mind has let drop.”\\

“Well. We’ll test the steel beneath yer rust. Like as not we’ll have need of it.”\\

“Come and see. Come and see.”\\

And with that, the man turns and disappears into the wreckage overhead.\\

At the summit of the stairwell, you find its archway is filled with a sheet of fog.\\
