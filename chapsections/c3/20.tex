You pass through the wall of fog, and the Everloyal follow in your wake. The group passes through a small, rough-hewn opening into a large underground chamber. The far end of this chamber opens into a loading dock. The world is blanketed in gray just beyond its pier.\\

What little light filters into this chamber catches off a massive haunch moving through the darkness. Triple the size of the largest warhorse, the beast's stature is so great that it escaped notice--seeming to be a statue or other architectural feature.\\

This beast's form is familiar, and yet unbeholden to any one animal; it's as if it were the product of an unholy union between boar of wolf. It snuffles through the corpses of at least two dozen guards, using its tusks to jostle them about.\\

“Snickersnee... hee hee...”\\

Sinecure Petanti steps backwards, striking his foot against a puddle. And the beast turns, its roar undulating throughout the cavern.

\emph{Large:} This entity occupies two distinct tiles, and requires head and tail tokens.\\

\emph{Great Foe:} This entity ignores all conditions (such as Knockback and Knockdown) inflicted by normal sources, except Blazing and Bleeding, and is immune to Backstab (but not Coup de Grâce).\\

\emph{Tottering:} If this entity assigns 6 damage tokens to \textbf{HP} in a single Round, it is inflicted with Knockdown upon assigning the sixth token.\\

\textbf{Attacks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Gore} -  Move 1. Deal 2 \emph{Unparryable} Pierce damage to an adjacent entity (from head tile).
\item \emph{Pounce} - Move 2. Deal 3 \emph{Unparryable} Crush damage and Knockdown in a half-moon pattern (from head tile).
\item \emph{Hind Kick} - Deal 3 Crush damage, Knockback 2, and Knockdown to an adjacent entity (from tail tile).
\item \emph{Charge} - Move 5 in a straight \& snaking line. Deal 3 Pierce damage, Knockback 3, and Knockdown to an adjacent entity (from head tile). If Snickersnee cannot land this attack, then Move 5 in a straight \& snaking line anyway.
\item \emph{Unearthly Roar} - Inflict \emph{Inevitable} Flinch on all hexes within 3 tiles (from head tile).

\subsection*{Victory}
The beast is frantic in death: a wailing, panicked thing. Despite its monstrous appearances it is very much still a mortal animal. Great gushers of blood spill from its many wounds, and with one last cry it sinks down into a great pool of itself.\\

Vagabond Lor approaches, knife in-hand. And, padding softly to the monster's side, he does it a mercy.\\

\subsection*{Defeat}
As your vision fades you can hear the Everloyal strike up a great panic. Their champion has fallen, and despite their zeal they cannot seem to place this event as part of His machinations.\\
