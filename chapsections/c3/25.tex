Stepping through the melted bars, you discover that the prisoners had pulled the cell’s bunkbeds together in a makeshift palisade. It did them little good; its wooden frames have been burnt to cinders. And similarly to the common area below, there are no bodies here--they’re likely all squirreled away in that thing’s horrid nest.\\

You pace slowly through the cell, your light casting the shadows of its wreckage against the walls in strange and unnerving shapes. Something shuffles against the floor and then quickly stops.\\

It came from the far corner: beneath an unsinged bunk.\\

As you draw closer, the air builds in an electric tension. And when you bend down to take a look beneath the rack, a shrill scream sends you reeling into the supline.\\

“O, you’re not hollow!”\\

A dimunitive, young girl crawls out from beneath the bed--like some farcical imitation of a child’s bogeyman. And, braced on her hands and knees, she dips her head in apology.\\

“I’m \lisp orry! I didn’t mean to \lisp care you!”\\

The girl talks with her hands: gesticulating rapidly while she lisps out an explanation.\\

“I heard the noi\lisp e\lispx of combat but... well, I didn’t think anyone would come for me--anyone \lisp till \lisp ane that i\lisp . I’m a\lisp uming... you killed him, then?”\\

The girl reclines onto her knees.\\
“Ah, he wa\lispx the fir\lisp t to lo\lisp e hi\lispx mind to the fog. He began to change \lisp oon after.”\\

“Well. They’re all in a better pla\lisp e now.”\\

“I’m A\lisp trid, by the way. But my friend\lispx call me Littletongue. And I think you’ve more than qualified a\lispx a friend.”\\
