“Ye...?”\\

“Champion, ye are no mere beast of burden. Ye speak His words with \emph{conviction}; a trait sadly rare amongst His faithful, even when we gathered in greater numbers.”\\

“O, how they would pester me for insight into the Mystic Keys. And what would they do with that knowledge? Nothing. No sooner than they’d learn one secret, they’d tire of it and ask for another.”\\

“His gifts...”\\

Eóghainn bangs his fist against a baluster.\\
“They are \emph{wasted} on these fools!”\\

“But not ye--of course. It would be a shame to lose such a precious soul to some trifling melee. Unfortunately, ye are also the sole combatant amongst the tattered remnants of His faithful.”\\

“I cannot guarantee yer survival, but I shall do my best to aid ye. Let me take ye by the hand, and guide ye through the Keys myself. Here: contemplate these secrets.”\\

“As yer faith grows, so too will their power.”\\

“Now go. Ye have yer orders, champion.”\\
