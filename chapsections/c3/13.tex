The mess hall is... a mess. Knocked over tables and chairs are strewn across the floor, along with some broken plates and their rotting portions.\\

A large pair of doors leads back to the complex offices, while a smaller door leads to the kitchen. A single staircase traverses the whole of the complex.\\
