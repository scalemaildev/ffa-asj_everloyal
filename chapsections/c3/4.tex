The second floor of the rotuna consists of a concentric balcony lined by a waist-high railing. A winding stairway leads to the main floor below; and a set of double doors is positioned atop its landing. The doors have been left askant, revealing a perpendicularly running hallway.\\

Both legs of the hallway take sharp corners leading further into the complex. And while the left wing of the hallway appears untouched, the right wing must have been the scene of a vicious melee. The floorboards are wet with blood, and an arm can be seen poking out from around the corner.\\
