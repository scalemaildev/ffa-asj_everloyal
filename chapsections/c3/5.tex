This security hallway once processed the cell block’s new arrivals. Now it’s a blackened ruin. Whatever happened here--likely an explosion--completely incinerated the contraband lockers. The scorchmarks originate from inside the cell block, but a thick fog obscures your view of the area.\\

The main doors have been left wide open. But their bars are melted in places that would suggest they had been closed during the fire. Someone must have come through here after the inferno.\\
