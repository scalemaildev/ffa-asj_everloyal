Littletongue has taken a seat cross-legged on the rotunda’s floor. A number of unfurled scrolls surround her in a semi-circle. Their parchment is illuminated by a tiny, glowing baubel that orbits the annalist like a celestial body.\\

“Allo!”\\

“Ju\lisp t going through \lisp ome material\lispx I found. Very dry... but I did find the floor plan!”\\

Littletongue motions with her hand, and the orb redirects itself towards a scroll bearing the complex’s layout. With her pinky finger, she points out the rotunda’s descending stairs and traces them to a large, open area that must lay below you.\\

“Thi\lispx look\lispx like our be\lisp t bet for e\lisp caping. There \lisp ould be a dock down there--and hopefully \lisp ome kind of ve\lisp el remain\lispx tied to it\lispx pier.”\\

Littletongue picks up the floor plan by a corner and offers it to you.\\
“Feel free to give it a look. Mmhm.”\\

“And thank you again for your help earlier!”\\

Littletongue sniffs, and rubs at her nose with a wrist. A hint of a black tattoo pokes out from her sleeve.\\

“Well. I’m afraid I don’t have much el\lisp e to offer.”\\
