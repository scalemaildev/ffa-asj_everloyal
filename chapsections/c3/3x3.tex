A short, thin woman. Almost grandmotherly in appearance. Her salt-and-pepper hair is wound tightly in a bun behind her head. A host of brass emblems and ribbons runs the length of her military blouse.\\

Her trousers are blackened from a mortal wound on her thigh. Glancing beyond the gate, you discover a trail of dried blood in the dim light. It travels deeper underground, having spilled across the steps like a shelf waterfall. Her last act must have been to drag herself up here.\\
