A short, thin woman. Almost grandmotherly in appearance. Her salt-and-pepper hair is wound tightly in a bun behind her head. A host of brass emblems and ribbons runs the length of her military blouse.\\

The warden.\\

Her trousers are soaked-through from a mortal wound on her thigh. Glancing beyond the gate, you discover a blood trail in the dim light. It travels deeper underground, spilling down the steps like a shelf waterfall. Her last act must have been to drag herself up here.\\

The dull glint of an iron key shines just a few steps past her corpse. Looks as though she dropped it in her death throes. Try as you might, youâ€™d never reach it from here.\\
