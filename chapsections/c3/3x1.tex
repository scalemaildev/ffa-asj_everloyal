The gate is of an uncomplicated design: a series of wrought iron balusters topped by spearpoint finials. It might've looked at home in any garden or graveyard, but feels out of place guarding this slick, stone passageway. Blemishes of rust abound; the salt air has not been kind.\\

The gate is bound by a padlock the size of your fist. It refuses all members of your pilfered keyring.\\
