A small enscarpment travels beneath the prison's exterior wall. Itâ€™s rather unremarkable, given the small size of the enscarpment and the fog that clings to it. But there is a large sprout of queergrass that would be obvious to even the most unintuitive observer.\\

A thick hemp rope dangles over one side of the enscarpment, just before its steep drop-off. A few tugs reveal that itâ€™s sturdily attached to something above. The other end of the cliffside is buried in rubble. This too appears to be climbable.\\
