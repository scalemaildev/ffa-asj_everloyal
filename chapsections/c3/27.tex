The barracks is the scene of a great slaughter. Three rows of blood-soaked cots line the room, their occupants sprawled out with slit throats and agape mouths. Towards the barracks' entrance, the cots are empty--and in some cases, smashed to pieces. The guards most have woken halfway through the massacre.\\

Each cot is staged with a hanger on its headboard, and a footlocker positioned at its other end. Most footlockers are staged with a pair of heavy boots; and most hangers bare a guard's uniform. It appears that the majority of guards didn't have the time to dress themselves.\\

The barracks' exterior wall hosts six windows, each left open--presumably to let the draft in during those hot nights. One such open window has a grappling hook latched to its corner. The steel hooks have left deep grooves along the wood. The window is located off in one corner, which would explain why the guards didn't hear the hook taking hold. Gazing out the window, you find that a thick hemp rope descends into the fog below.\\
