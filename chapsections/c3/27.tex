This barracks is the scene of a great slaughter. Three rows of blood-soaked cots line the room, their occupants sprawled out with slit throats and agape mouths. Towards the barracks' entrance, the cots are empty. The guards most have woken halfway through the massacre.\\

Each cot is staged with a hanger on its headboard, and a footlocker positioned at its other end. Most footlockers are staged with a pair of heavy boots; and their hangers bare a guard's uniform. It appears that the majority of guards didn't have time to dress themselves. Some of the footlockers are pushed together to serve as a table for a dice game.\\

The barracks' exterior wall hosts six windows, each of them left open--presumably to let the draft in during those hot nights. One such window has a grappling hook latched to its sill. This window is located off in one corner, which would explain why the guards didn't hear it taking hold. Its steel hooks have left deep grooves along the wall.\\

The barracksâ€™ entrance leads to a perpendicular hallway. One side appears intact, but the other has a great deal of blood on its floorboards.\\
