This was the scene of a great slaughter. Three rows of blood-soaked cots line the room, their occupants sprawled out with mouths agape and throats slit. But the cots closest to the entrance are empty. The barracks must have woken halfway through the massacre.\\

Each cot features a wooden footlocker, and a clothes hanger dangling from its footboard. These hangers still bear crisp uniforms, and pairs of heavy boots are staged beneath them. No one had time to dress themselves, apparently. Off in one corner of the room, some of the footlockers were pushed together to serve as a table for a dice game.\\

The barracks' exterior wall hosts six windows. Each of them was left open: to let a draft in during the night, probably. One such window has a grappling hook latched to its sill. Its steel hooks have left deep grooves along the wall. A fully dressed guard--presumably the night watch--is slumped over nearby. \\

The barracksâ€™ entrance leads to a perpendicular hallway. One side appears intact, but the other has a great deal of blood on its floorboards.\\
