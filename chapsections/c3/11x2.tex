“No-no! O... O-friend?”\\

You barrel into the enclosed space, knocking your ratfriend nearly into the hole, and slam the door behind you. It soon begins to rattle and shake, but you lean all your weight into its handle. Try as they might, those adventurers cannot pull it open.\\

A vicious knocking soon begins--but this door has surely sustained such a pounding many a time. Eventually, the knocker quits. You can hear low, angry whispers from the barracks. Then the sounds of struggle and huffing. And finally nothing.\\

Time passes. You and your ratfriend wait with clenched noses and straining ears. Eventually Niki places its face against the cracks in the door and takes a look around.\\

“Gone-gone.”\\

The two of you spill from the lavatory into an empty barracks. The adventurers are gone now. The grappling hook affixed to a window implies that they won't be returning.\\

Ratfriend Niki approaches you in sheepish strides, and places a small keychain in your hands.\\

"Ro-tunda? Okay-kay."\\

Niki scampers through the wreck and ruin of the guard barracks and disappears into the complex. The fog has receded from the doorway.\\
