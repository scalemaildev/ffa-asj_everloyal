Your feet kick up wisps of fog, which grows heavier the deeper you descend, until it swells past your knees. The stone masonry of the complex's walls soon gives way to a sheer foundation, and then finally natural stone--more cavern than cellar.\\

Eventually you reach an impasse: a wrought iron gate. A uniformed woman lays dead against it, her back bent in an unnatural fashion and her face pressed against its bars.\\
