As you follow the winding stairs downwards, the air becomes damp and tinged with a briny taste. The stone masonry of the complex's walls soon gives way to a sheer foundation, and then finally natural stone--more cavern than cellar. Your feet kick up wisps of fog, which grows heavier the deeper you descend until it swells past your knees.\\

Eventually you reach an impasse: a wrought iron gate. A uniformed woman lays dead against it from the other side, her back bent in an unnatural fashion with her face pressed against the bars.\\
