On closer inspection, this nest of burnt corpses contains both prisoners and guards. Their arms and legs have been broken and entwined, as if the thing meant to weave them into a quilt. One peculiar body catches your eye: a recent addition to the pile. She clearly wasn’t a prisoner, and yet she isn't wearing a guard’s uniform either. Her colorful leather chestpiece is badly burnt, but you can make out the embroidered emblem of a golden hand.\\
