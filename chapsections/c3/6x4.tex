Zealot Eóghainn sits halfway up the stairs to the second floor. His hands are steepled over his lips, and he looks to be in a state of deep concentration.\\

At first he speaks without taking his fingers from his mouth.\\
“As the leader of this holy mission...”\\

Then he drops his hands and stares you in the eye.\\
“My word is the word of King Z*l. Believe in me as ye believe in Him. I must have everyone’s complete and unyielding loyalty if we are to succeed.”\\

“I am the last surviving member of the Inner Circle. Therefore, I alone possess the means of achieving His resurrection.”\\

The zealot closes his eyes.\\
“It all comes down to me. But I have prepared my entire life for the task ahead. I shall not be found wanting.”\\

He opens his eyes again, and points a crooked finger at your face.\\
“Champion of the Black and Golden Key, go forth and purge this place of those who might do me harm. And seek out our means of egress. I shall remain here and contemplate the Mystic Keys in search of guidance.”\\
