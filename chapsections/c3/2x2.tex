You pick out a route and start to climb.\\

This wooden hydra of upturned chair legs shivers and shakes with your every move. And at times the whole barricade feels as though it might give out, but eventually you reach the summit.\\

Your triumph does not last long. The chairback beneath your feet betrays you: slipping free and tumbling from the pile. You manage to leap to another foothold, and then another--until you find yourself dancing down to the safety of solid ground.\\

Vagabond Lor is waiting for you at the bottom; his hands are still upturned as if he'd been waiting to catch you. With a half-cough, half-chuckle he returns to his place against the wall. And you discover that your feet have a sureness to them you didn't realize before.\\
