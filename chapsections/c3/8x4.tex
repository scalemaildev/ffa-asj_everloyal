You lift the man's head up, and slide the pillow out from beneath his neck. And, ever so gently, you begin to smother him.\\

At first, he takes little notice of his impending death. But then something in the recesses of his brain sounds an alarm, and he begins to gasp and seizure beneath the pillow. His head twists left and right, but you pin him between your elbows and lean in with your full weight. Eventually, his struggles soften. And from beneath the downy pillow you hear him utter something with his final breath.\\

Lightning arcs across your mind. You \emph{know} that word.\\
