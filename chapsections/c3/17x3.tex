Eóghainn leads you down the stairwell with a confidence unique to men of unwavering faith. That wretched, screaming thing is still shambling through the mezzanine corridors when the two of you arrive. The zealot hails it with a raised hand--as if it were merely another traveler at a crossroad.\\

And then the thing vanishes beneath a stream of syllables that come from Eóghainn’s mouth in steady cadence like a funeral dirge.\\
>> Engorged Soul (30)\\
\notegain{c315a} Lukso is slain\\

The two of you continue through the mezzanine and over its crumbling flagstones. Upon beholding the nest of corpses, Eóghainn merely shakes his head and asks you to take him to where the others are gathered.\\

>> Return to the rotunda -- \turnto{c31}
