You find Vagabond Lor propped up against a wall by the barricade.\\

“Ay there.”\\

“I know how this looks. But we’re not really... fighters, y’know. Hope you don’t think we’re just lazy. Hah ha.”\\

“I’m sure we can help you in other ways, though. For example...”\\

Lor scans the room for a moment.\\
“Do you have any qualms with the art of pyromancy?”\\

“Now, now--before you go a-kicking up a row. It’s just a tool, ain’t it? And in my humble opinion, we don’t have the luxury of being choosy.”\\

“We need to make use of whatever we can get our mitts on, right? Anything and everything.”\\

“So, even if it is blasphemy--\emph{arguably}--it’s blasphemy for a righteous purpose. Hah ha.”\\

“How about it?”\\
