What little remains of the cell block’s mezzanine rests atop the fog like an island in a roiling ocean. \\

To one side there is the common area, and the heap of rubble you climbed to escape it.\\

The other side ends in a sheer cut; the entire exterior wall is gone, revealing a wide vista of a fog-choked riverside.\\

The second story is still accessible via the lone remaining stairwell, which spirals upwards like some twisted minaret. And while the remaining cells are locked, their bars have been so badly warped that you might still explore them--with a light source.\\

And it would be possible to descend the rubble again, but it’s a less appealing option than just entering through the hygiene processing room. The raised walkway is perilous, but the room itself appears mostly intact. It may be possible to explore the other side of the block as well, but the walkway is a mere hand’s breadth of shimmying room.\\
