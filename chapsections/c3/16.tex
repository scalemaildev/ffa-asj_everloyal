What little is left of this cell blockâ€™s mezzanine rests atop the fog like an islet in a frozen sea. Its entire exterior wall is gone, revealing a panoramic view of a fog-choked riverside. Remnants of the roof and upper floor stab into an overcast sky. And a single, remaining stairwell spirals upwards like a twisted minaret, presenting a possible--if perilous--ascent.\\

Bits of debris from the ceiling spackle the mezzanine's floor. The largest pieces were repurposed for that horrid nest of corpses. The melted bars of the cloister cells gives little hope for finding survivors. Likely, the entire cell block's population are knotted together in that nightmare.\\

This mezzanine's walkways have survived, but only just so. The path to the hygiene processing room is in decent shape, but the other way has been reduced to little more than a hand's breadth of shimmying room.\\

It may be possible to descend the rubble again: back to the yard. But the lack of visiblity and uneven scree does not make it an appealing option. If the two cell blocks are truly identical, the hygiene processing room would be the safer option.\\
