You wander through the halls of the complexâ€™s second floor. The floor's layout appears to be typical for an administrative building: a circuit hallway begirt on both sides by concentric series of rooms. One end passes by the rotunda, and the other borders what appears to be a barracks--its entrance is shrouded by fog.\\

The exterior wall hosts a small stairwell at its midpoint. The rest of the hallway consists of an unremarkable series of doors--all identical save for one at a far end, which is secured by a dual lock system and reinforced by iron crossbars. That must be an armory.\\
