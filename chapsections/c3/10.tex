You find yourself standing in half an armory. The rest of the room has collapsed and crumbled down the foggy cliffside below, but what little floorspace remains glitters with rows of polished weaponry. The lone surviving armor stand features a heavier variant of the guards' uniform, with iron lamellae sewn about its chest and shoulders--as if some scarecrow had been assigned to a most hazardous detail.\\

Across the gap where the exterior wall once stood, you can see the remnants of a raised walkway. That leads to one of the cell block mezzanines, but it's too far and too high to reach from here.\\

Whatever destroyed this armory also laid bare the internal mechanisms of its door's dual lock system. A few flips here and there and it creaks open.\\
