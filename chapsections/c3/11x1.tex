A hinge squeals. It's a short-lived sound, barely audible above a whisper, but it makes the hairs on your neck stand at attention. You are not alone.\\

Casting a stealthy glance around the barracks, you find only one likely source: a plain, wooden door tucked into a far corner. It's slightly ajar now--and wasn't before.\\
