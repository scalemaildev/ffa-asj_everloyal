You open a series of doors revealing uninteresting rooms of mundane purpose. A cleaning closet. Some filing cabinets. Office supplies and a spare chair.\\

Only a single room on the exterior side promises reward: the well-kept office formerly belonging to the warden or someone of similar rank. The coat on the standing hanger has three chevrons running along its sleeves. Perhaps the Sergeant of the Guard once sat here, occupying himself with paperwork tedium.\\

The desk is spotless. Its ashtray likely never served its intended purpose, instead playing host to a copper schilling, metal toothpick, and a strange ring. The topmost of its two drawers contains only an inkwell, letter opener, and some envelopes and blank parchment. The other drawer is locked.\\

Nothing else in the office piques your interest. A banner on the wall displays a white tower on a gray field, but you retain no memory of what it might represent.\\
