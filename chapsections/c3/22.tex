The warden's chambers maintain an air of humble dignity; a militant sort of fastidiousness that speaks of a great mind confined to a lesser station. Its weathered desk and ripped chair have only just begun to develop light coatings of dust. Even the chamber pot could pass for dinnerware.\\

This room's appearance is unique within the complex: green wallpaper and wooden paneling. A few portraits and landscapes hang about the walls, and a patterned carpet covers the floor. There’s even a stuffed bear--that must’ve been quite the chore to get up here.\\

The warden’s letters are collected into a neat pile on her desk.\\
