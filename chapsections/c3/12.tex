This room is checkered by cubicles, their wooden dividers doubling as file organizers. While many of these cubbies serve their intended purpose, it looks like the guards used them for general storage: everything from spare boots to pigskin balls and wilting potted plants. A great deal of this room’s furniture is missing. The scratch marks lead back to the rotunda.\\

Each cubicle is dominated by an identical desk of cheap appearance--those that weren’t carried off for the barricade. Some are tidy, while others are piled high with yellowing documents. Above the office entrance, a banner depicts a white tower on a gray field. Whatever organization this is, they've managed to fit an awful lot of paperwork into something as simple as locking people in cages.\\

The room features only two exits. One leads to a mess hall, while the other leads to the complex's central rotunda.\\
