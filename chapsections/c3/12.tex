This large, open office is bisected by a flagstone walkway struck through its hardwood floor. The walkway is bordered by cubicles on both sides, their waist-high wooden dividers doubling as file organizers. While many of these cubbies serve their intended purpose, it looks like the guards used them for general storage: everything from spare boots to dice games and rotting potted plants.\\

Each cubicle is dominated by an identical desk of cheap appearance. Some are tidy, while others are piled high with yellowing documents. Above the office entrance, a banner depicts a gray tower on a white field. Whatever organization this is, they've managed to fit an awful lot of paperwork into something as simple as locking people in cages.\\

The room features only two exits. One leads to a mess hall, while the other leads to the complex's central rotunda.\\
