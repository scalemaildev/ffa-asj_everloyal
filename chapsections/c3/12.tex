This large, open room is bisected by a flagstone walkway striking through the hardwood floor. The walkway is bordered by cubicles, their waist-high wooden dividers doubling as file cabinets.\\

Each cubicle is dominated by an identical, cheap-looking desk. Some are tidy, others are piled high with yellowing documents. Above it all, a banner hangs with a gray tower against a white field. Whatever organization that coat of arms represents, they've managed to fit an awful lot of paperwork into something as simple as locking people in cages.\\

The room features only two entrances. One leads to a mess hall, while the other leads to the complex's central rotunda.\\
