Venturing forth into the blasted cell block, you encounter the vague shapes of its appurtenances within the fog. Its yard is furnished similarly to the one in which you were interned. Crude tables are joined by stools resting uneasily on their cracked legs. No whipping post is present; instead, the pillory features a trio of stockades. They are empty, as is the rest of the area--no sign of your comrades, dead or alive.\\

Scorchmarks carpet the flagstone floor in strange, crisscrossing patterns: arcs and streaks like the product of a child’s paintbrush. There is no rhyme or reason to them, and not even so much as a charred corpse left in the fire’s wake. Just a few mess tables burnt to cinders here and there.\\

Further into the fog, you discover a massive pile of rubble. The block's mezzanine balcony has crumbled, presenting a possible--if rather steep--ascent to the next level.\\

The block’s main entrance is still wide open. There is also a set of iron-barred doors that should lead to the hygiene processing room, but they won’t open from this side.\\
