Venturing forth into the common area, you pass by the vague shapes of mess tables and stools within the fog. The block is furnished similarly to the one in which you were interned. No whipping post is present, but there is a trio of stockades. They are empty, as is the rest of the area--no sign of your comrades, dead or alive.\\

Scorchmarks carpet the floor in strange, crisscrossing patterns: arcs and streaks like the product of a child’s paintbrush. There is no rhyme or reason to them, and not even so much as a charred corpse in the fire’s wake. Just a few mess tables burnt to cinders here and there.\\

Further into the common area, you discover a massive pile of rubble. The mezzanine balcony has collapsed in large chunks, presenting a steep ascent to the upper level. There is also an entrance for what should be the hygiene processing room, but it won’t open from this side. The only other egress is back to the security hallway.\\
