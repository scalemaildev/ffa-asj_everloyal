Venturing forth into the common area, you encounter the vague shapes of its appurtenances within the fog. The block is furnished similarly to the one in which you were interned. Crude tables are joined by rickety stools, many resting uneasily on cracked legs. No whipping post is present; instead, the pillory features a trio of stockades. They are empty, as is the rest of the common area--no sign of your comrades, dead or alive.\\

Scorchmarks carpet the flagstone floor in strange, crisscrossing patterns: arcs and streaks like the product of a child’s paintbrush. There is no rhyme or reason to them, and not even so much as a charred corpse left in the fire’s wake. Just a few mess tables burnt to cinders here and there.\\

Further into the common area, you discover a massive pile of rubble. The block's mezzanine balcony has crumbled, presenting a possible--if rather steep-ascent to the next level.\\

The common area's main entrance is still wide open. There is also an iron-barred door to what should be the hygiene processing room, but it won’t open from this side.\\
