The fog grows thinner the further you climb. At the top of the ascent, you’re finally able to make sense of your surroundings--and the full extent of their destruction. The block's entire exterior wall has been torn away, along with its roof and most of the top floor. Rows of flagstone tiling end in a sheer cut overlooking a fog-choked riverside.\\

A breeze passes through the exposed mezzanine, producing a familiar whisking noise. It has likely been a long while since you last heard it, but the sound is unmistakable: swaying branches. Venturing forth, you encounter a strange, pale species of tree that has taken root amongst the rubble. It stands at the height of two men, and bears no leaves or fruit. Its bone white trunk sprouts from a semi-circle of rubble; and you find that this heap was not merely the chance product of a crumbling ceiling. Its construction looks to have been purposeful, like the piled stones of bygone, primitive eras. Pacing around to its opening, you discover two dozen or so burnt corpses are piled within. So that's where the block's prisoners ended up: as a macabre sort of potting material.\\

The branches quiver again, but this time there is no wind to brush them. Then the pale trunk unfurls, revealing something of a cross between a corpse and a dead tree. Its body pulses with a red glow, as if a hearth had been kindled within its gnarled belly. And when it lets out a scream, a jet of flame erupts from its jagged mouth.\\

\subsection*{Victory}
The thing falls to its knees--or the closest anatomical feature that could be described as such. In a pose reminiscent of a drunkard’s morning-after, it issues a few, wet coughs and then spews forth a stream of molten bile. After one last spurt, it collapses into the pool of its own steaming ichor. Its barklike skin sizzles and pops, giving off a rancid smell redolent of a tannery.\\

You have no word with which to describe the creature you’ve just slain. Your eyes likely never beheld such a thing, in this life or any other. But some of its features were... human in appearance, and disturbingly so.\\

On closer inspection, its nest of burnt corpses contains both prisoner and guards. Their arms and legs have been broken and entwined, as if the thing meant to weave them into a quilt. One peculiar man catches your eye. He clearly wasn’t a prisoner, and yet he isn't wearing a guard’s uniform either. His colorful leather chestpiece is badly burnt, but you can make out the embroidered emblem of a golden hand.\\

\subsection*{Defeat}
The fight passes in a blur, leaving you with only a single memory of the ordeal: its searing pain. You stumble backwards and try to regain your footing, but your foot finds no purchase--only air. There is a brief moment of terror as you slip from the mezzanine, and tumble down the rubble to the cell block below. At the bottom of the slope, you raise your head to discover a pulsing, red glow making its way down into the fog. You manage to struggle to your feet, and limp across the common area to the safety of the security hallway. Once inside, you wrestle with the lever until the main doors close, and collapse against a wall.\\

When you awaken, the scorchmarks streaking across the walls take on a new and terrifying meaning.\\

\subsection*{Retreat}
It’s too late to do anything for the comrades of this cell block, but you resolve not to join them in that horrendous nest. The least you can do is survive.\\

You flee down the slope and across the common area to the safety of the security hallway. A glance over your shoulder reveals a pulsing, red glow bounding through the fog after you. Once inside, you wrestle with the lever until the main doors close.\\
