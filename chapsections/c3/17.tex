Passing through the fog barrier, you stumble into a dream-like scene. The hallway ahead is identical to the one in which you were previously interred... but missing in sections, as if you were failing to picture the place in its entirety. You stand amongst a vast panorama of overcast sky and fog-choked environs: a flagstone island in the sky. A few emaciated corpses lay in soft repose around its wreckage.\\

A section of tile breaks loose, dropping to the mezzanine below with a loud crack.\\

The man from before emerges from the ruins as if summoned by the sound. At this distance, you can finally get a look as his face--and find it familiar. This man spoke the truth: he played some integral part in your life's story.\\

"Our champion has washed ashore. And now we shall assess the salvage."\\

The man turns his palms upwards, and a few of the corpses begin to stir.\\

\subsection*{Victory}
The man stumbles backwards a few steps, then drops to a knee and clutches his side.\\

“Very well.”\\

He gasps and pants.\\
“Ye have... \emph{haa}... rightfully reassumed the mold that begotten ye. \emph{Haa}... \emph{haa}...”\\

He rakes a forearm across his brow, plastering its arm hairs against his skin, then stands.\\

“I am Eóghainn, of the Inner Circle. And I shall be yer light and yer whisper, such as ye shall be the champion of the Black and Golden Key.”\\

Eóghainn speaks again, but this time it is not directed to you. He mutters a short parable. Its one you recall having heard before: the tale of a son who rescued his father from a besieged city by dragging him out in a canoe. When the story is finished, the wounds on both of your bodies vanish. A miracle of the Mystic Keys.\\

“And ye say there be others? Doubtless they are in great want of guidance in these darkened hours.”\\

“Take me to them.”\\

\subsection*{Defeat}
You lay in defeat. A trio of risen corpses shamble towards you with grasping hands. Then the man raises his arms, and they collapse in place.\\

“A valiant attempt. But just an attempt, nonetheless.”\\

The man approaches you with a hand outstretched, and lifts you onto your feet.\\

“I am Eóghainn, of the Inner Circle.”\\

Eóghainn speaks again, but this time it is not directed to you. He mutters a short parable.
