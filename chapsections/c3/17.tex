Passing through the wall of fog, you stumble into a hallway not unlike the one in which you were previously interred. But the roof is gone, and the cells have crumbled into each other. You are left standing on a windswept precipice rising high above the fog-choked terrain below. And amongst the wreckage you hear the sound of clapping.\\
“And now we will see the true mettle of His faithful.”\\
A man steps out from one of the cells, his hands still clasped in applause. Then he turns his palms upwards, and a few of the corpses begin to stir.\\

\subsection*{Victory}
Eóghainn stumbles backwards a few steps, then drops to a knee and clutches his side.\\

“Very well.”\\

The man gasps and pants.\\
“You have... haa... passed the first of your trials. Haa... haa...”\\

He rakes a forearm across his brow, plastering the arm hairs against the skin, then stands.\\

“I am Eóghainn, of the Inner Circle.”\\

“And you say there are others? Doubtless they are in great want of guidance. ”\\

“Take me to them.”\\
