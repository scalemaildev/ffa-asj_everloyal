Entering the kitchen, you're immediately struck by the ripe smell of its rotting foodstuffs. The prison's pests have grown bold in the absence of its guards. A parish of rats beholds your arrival with mild annoyance, as if you'd intruded upon the place's true masters. Their bloated bellies drag along the ground whenever they deign to move.\\

The kitchen is furnished with professional appliances and plentiful stores. Food and drink was likely the lone comfort of those guards stationed in such a bleak environment. A trio of large, rusted cauldrons must have prepared the prisoners' daily gruel. Your stomach grumbles in reminder that you havenâ€™t eaten recently.\\
