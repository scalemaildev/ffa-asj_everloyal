This raised walkway travels atop the yard's perimeter. Its exterior wall and ceiling are gone, leaving the fog-stricken strip of flagstone exposed to the elements. What little foot room it offers narrows further and further until giving out completely. There appears to be an armory on the far side of this gap. Most of it has fallen into the fog below, but the remaining chests and weapon racks promise a reward... if you can make it there.\\

The cell block's lone, remaining stairwell spirals overhead. Its archway is gone along with most of the circular wall, but the stairs themselves are intact.\\
