This raised walkway travels atop the yard's perimeter. Its exterior wall and ceiling are gone, leaving the fog-stricken strip of flagstone exposed to the elements. The walkway narrows as it nears the main complex before giving out completely, leaving only a hand's breadth of footroom.\\

There appears to be an armory on the far side of the crumbling gap. Most of it has fallen into the fog below, but the remaining chests and weapon racks promise a reward... if you can make it there.\\

The cell block's lone, remaining stairwell spirals overhead. Its archway is gone along with most of the wall, but the stairs are mostly intact.\\
