This hallway's entire exterior floorspace is taken up by an infirmary. It hosts two occupants: one mad, the other dead.\\

The dead guard's severed leg has left a trail of blood leading back to the hallway. Looks like he was crawling for something in the cabinets but didn't make it in time. You tilt one of them open.\\

The room's other occupant is dressed in prisoner's rags, and strapped to his bed by three leather belts. He takes no notice of your approach. His blank eyes stare up at the ceiling; his mouth opens and closes mutely like a fish on a deck. Judging by the bed sores and bloated stomach, he's been wasting away here for quite some time.\\
