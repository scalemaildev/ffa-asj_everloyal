Your hands seem to move on their own accord now, twisting the letter opener slightly: just enough to turn the lock's core. You dig a thumbnail into the side of the keyhole to keep it in place. And, with practiced patience, you bounce the tool up and down until you hear those tumblers click into place.\\
