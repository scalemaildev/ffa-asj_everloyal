Lor steps into an alcove within the barricade, and motions for you to join him. After one last glance around, the two of you squat down as if you were about to shoot dice.\\

The vagabond holds out his hand, and snaps his fingers. An orange glow fills his palm, emanating from a tiny ember that’s appeared in its center.\\

“Easy now. There’s a process for this... a tradition, kinda.”\\

“Not that--not that I care for that sorta thing. But it’s impressive, ain’t it? How far back the line stretches?”\\

“From me to you, and from my teacher to me. All the way back to the Thief of Fire himself. Hah ha.”\\

“Hold out your hand.”\\

You do so, and Lor places his hand over yours. It hurts--as grabbing a hot coal might. Lor squeezes your hand and makes a shushing noise. Soon, the pain passes into a gentle warmth. When the vagabond releases your palm, a tiny ember has been left there--just like his.\\

“Fire, fire. Light our path. Fire, fire. Warm our souls.”\\

“So, there you go. Let me teach you a few tricks while we’re at it.”\\
\gainx{Cauterize}\\
\gainx{Flameburst}\\
\gainx{Stoke Ember}\\

“And remember: let’s keep this just between us, right? Hah ha.”\\
