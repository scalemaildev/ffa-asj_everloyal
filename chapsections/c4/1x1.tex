Zealot Eóghainn coughs purposefully, drawing the gathering’s attention to himself.\\

“Ye have borne witness now. All of ye. Our purpose was spoken of in the Keys eons before our birth. We shall not be denied. Beast or man, it differs little.”\\

“I will contemplate them in search of answers... when circumstances allow. For now, we must journey onward.”\\

“And journey where, I wonder?”\\
