You awake on the cold, stone floor knowing--once again--very little of where you are or how you came to be here.\\

“Rise, Adones. Champion of the Black and Golden Key.”\\

Adones? A hand is proffered before you. Gazing up its length, the sight of the old zealot’s face stirs your failing memory back to life.\\
\notegain{!!c41b!!} Zealot Eóghainn has named you ‘Adones’\\
>> Erase all but 1 \textbf{HMN}\\
>> If the character sheet has 0 \textbf{HMN}, then mark 1 \textbf{HMN}\\

Eóghainn is smiling, but the smile seems... disappointed.\\

“Ye have served yer station. It is not our place to question the how or why of it. If we are truly meant for such knowledge, I will decipher it from the Keys.”\\

You raise your head to discover a newcomer to the Everloyal: a woman dressed in colorful leathers. An emblem of a golden hand is pinned to her tall collar. She sits cross-legged on the paw of the slain Auroks, a bloody longsword bedded across her knees. She runs a handkerchief along its blade, sending black-red ropes of gore onto the cavern floor.\\

“Ye would do well to rest lightly on yer laurels, mercenary. Ye may be quick with a blade, but ye have not earned our trust... yet.”\\

“Ye can start with yer name.”\\
