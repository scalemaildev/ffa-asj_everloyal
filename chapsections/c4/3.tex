Jacquelyn has busied herself about the dinghy. From the purposeful manner of her actions, it is clear that she is well-versed in the operation of watercraft. She speaks to you without pausing in her efforts.\\

“If there is one thing of which I am still certain... in this maddened world... it is the route back to Gran Selidore. I have memorized it like a religion of my own.”\\

She ties off a bowline and turns to you, straightening out her lower back.\\

“But I do nothing out of charity. There is something within this complex that I require in exchange.”\\

“A device of sorcerous nature. It was only described to me once--and that description has slipped from my mind, but I will know it when I see it. It should be hidden somewhere typical for things of great value.”\\

“Find me this device, and my services are yours. I care little for the history of your kind, dark as it may be. And you’ll risk no betrayal, for a Goldhand’s word is her life’s blood.”\\

“Greed is the most steadfast of morals, no? Hon hon hon!”\\
