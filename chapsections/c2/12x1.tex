“Strip down and have a seat on the bench.”\\

The jailer points you to a long bench running down the length of the room. A waist-high dividing wall separates it from the area in which he stands: a section of smooth flagstone with wash buckets and a floor drain. It appears that you’ve wandered into a hygiene processing room--and one staffed by the jailer.\\

Unlike your febrile nightmare, he isn’t armed with a rusted meat hook. He does have a truncheon hanging off his belt however, and is still very much hollowed. This particular bout of insanity appears to have re-instilled him with his sense of military posture. He upends a wash bucket over a nude corpse, and stares down at it expectantly.\\

“I said take a seat, cultist,” he says, without lifting his gaze from the body.\\
