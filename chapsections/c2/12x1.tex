You stand in a long room divided lengthwise by a waist-high flagstone wall.\\

One side of the divide--the side the door opens onto--is divided again by a bench running its entire length. On the far side of the room, opposite its door, a stairway leads downwards.\\

Past the dividing wall, the room is centered around a drain towards which the floor slopes gently down. This, along with the wash buckets, reveals the room’s purpose to be for prisoner hygiene. It’s an oddly generous precaution, especially for those convicted of such a crime--but dirty prisoners often become sick prisoners, and a sick prisoner can easily lead to sick guards. Surely, the hygiene process was not made pleasant--or warm.\\

The state of the soap stuck to one bucket’s bottom implies that it has been a very long time since any washing occurred here.\\
