This corridor passes by a familiar landmark: an archway blocked by rubble. Niki came through here, though there’s no sign of where your ratfriend went afterwards.\\

The corridor takes an abrupt turn after the collapsed stairwell, leading to a raised walkway overlooking the cell block. That appears to be the way deeper into the complex. In the other direction lays the rest of the mezzanine level.\\
