This corridor is missing a few chunks of flagstone here and there. It passes by the archway of a stairwell, and then takes an abrupt turn afterwards. Past the bend, you discover evidence that the prisonâ€™s condition is not merely a product of the passage of time. The walkway's exterior wall has gone concave, as if it were hit by a battering ram or trebuchet volley. Rubble from the impact litters the way forward, and the damage only gets worse further on.\\

In the other direction lays the rest of the mezzanine.\\
