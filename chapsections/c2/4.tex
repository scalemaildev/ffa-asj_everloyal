This corridor passes by the archway of a stairwell, and then takes an abrupt turn afterwards: leading to a raised walkway that curves atop the perimeter of the cell block’s yard. In the other direction lays the central mezzanine.\\

There is evidence here that the prison’s condition is not merely a product of the passage of time. The corridor's exterior wall has gone concave, as if it were hit by a battering ram or trebuchet volley. Rubble from the impact litters the floor, and the damage only gets worse further along the raised walkway.\\
