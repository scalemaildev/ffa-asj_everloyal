You take a seat on the bench and wait to see what the madman has planned. He empties another washbucket over the nude corpse and stares at her intently, as if she might wake at any moment and begin to bathe.\\

“You damned monsters...”\\

“You ruined... you...”\\

The jailer squats with his hands on his knees, as if he were lecturing a small child. This looks like as good an opportunity as any...\\

You get up, and make your way across the wet flagstone on the balls of your feet. The jailer is still whinging to the dead woman when your shadow falls over him. He does not turn his head, nor acknowledge your presence, as if you’d disappeared from this world no sooner than he turned his back on you. The floor drain soon serves its purpose once again, turning a dark crimson color.\\
