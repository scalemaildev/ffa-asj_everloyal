You see stars for a moment, and then it all goes black.\\

A splash of cool water brings you back again. The jailer’s maddened eyes stare down into your own, and then he ditches the washbucket to the floor with a clatter.\\
“That was the last straw,” he says, and squats with his hands on his knees as if he were lecturing a small child.\\

“You damned monsters... you ruined... you...”\\

A dribble of drool escapes his lips. He’s lost again--no longer staring at you, but through you. You slowly reach a hand out, and your fingers brush the rusted floor drain. It’s loose--and sharp.\\

The fight isn’t easy, or clean. The drain’s edge bites into your palm, but not as deeply as those cuts you make on the jailer's neck. He starts to lose momentum as more of his life’s blood leaves him. Eventually, he keels over and expires in a pitiful repose.\\
