The cell block’s appurtenances tell a wordless story of what happened here:\\

A whipping post that’s been felled like a cut tree. The scattered remnants of mess tables and shirt cloths. Some smashed chamber pots. A pile of filed chair legs--what looks like their first attempt at fashioning spears. The corpses of a dozen or so fallen comrades.\\

The place is shrouded in a wasted sort of quiet: the kind reserved for spent arguments and spoiled battlefields. But its silence is soon broken by a plaintive cry from one of the cells.\\
