You place your hand on the hilt. The hollowed guard takes no notice--yet. His attention is still wholly devoted to knocking his head against the bedpost.\\

So you close your fingers, and give the hilt a tug. It offers little resistance, and so you pull again harder. Bit by bit, you draw it out; your eyes shift from the scabbard to the hollow’s blank face and then back again. When you finally manage to free the blade, its tip scrapes against the flagstones and gives the guard a start. He jolts upright, as if you’d woken him from a dream.\\

The two of you stare at each other for a moment; his naked sword weighs heavy in your thieving hand. The hollow’s wild eyes regard you with something you have no words to describe: an emotion wholly alien to any sane mind. Then, in a rasping voice, he speaks...\\

“Did you find it yet?”\\

You nod, and the hollow breathes a sigh of relief. As you retreat from the cell, you hear that steady rhythm of bangs start up again.\\
