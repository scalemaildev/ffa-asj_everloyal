This balcony is bordered by a waist-high railing. It would give you a good look at the yard below, were it not smothered by this all-permeating fog. No ceiling is visible, but it’s unclear whether the fog has breached the prison like a besieging army, or if the complex is just an open-air design. Either way, your vantage is of little use.\\

Staring hard into the billowing, gray nothingess below, you can make out some shapes here and there. Vague hints of the things you’d expect to find in a cell block’s yard: a mess table, knocked-over chairs, a scaffold for a whipping post. But then your straining eyes begin playing tricks on you...\\

Impossible. Waiting in two neat rows are what appears to be human silhouettes. But surely this place’s prisoners--sane or otherwise--would not stand for muster?\\
