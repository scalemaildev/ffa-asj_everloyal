This raised walkway once looked out over the cell block’s yard--before its roof caved in along with much of the exterior wall. The fog has seized upon this opportunity, engulfing the passage in an opaque screen. You won’t get much further in that direction without a torch to light your way. The other direction leads to the rest of the mezzanine.\\

Some of the collapsed wall has created a convenient niche.\\
