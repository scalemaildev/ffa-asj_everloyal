You pick your way towards the voice, stepping over the debris and corpses. The cell is occupied by two comrades, seated in opposite corners. They rise and approach the bars in unison.\\

The long-haired man is the first to speak.\\
“You must be the one that rat-thing mentioned. Well, it went off ahead into the rest of the complex. Damned if I know why. Seemed concerned about a ‘snickersnee’--whatever that is. Hah ha.”\\

His cellmate is much taller, rail-thin, and completely bald.\\
“This snickersnee... perhaps some sort of, um, weapon? But in our captors’ hands, possibly. Um. We were wondering about the possibility... of you, um, contriving some way of affecting a release of this door? The rat-thing had alluded to this, um, possibility during our conv--our brief conversation. Do you by any chance possess some sort of key, or know the whereabouts of such a key--”\\

“Shut up! Shut up!”\\

“Listen, you’ve got to get us out of here. If the fog doesn’t turn me mad, his prattling will. Hah ha.”\\
