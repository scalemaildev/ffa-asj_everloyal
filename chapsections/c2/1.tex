This raised section of flagstone forms a mezzanine overlooking the rest of the cell block. Opposite its balcony stands a T-junction, whose corridors wrap around the blockâ€™s perimeter. One such corridor shows signs of structural damage, while the other appears mostly intact. The shattered remnant of a catwalk decorates the mezzanine like a centrepiece, and serves as a reminder of your encounter with those mad bedfellows above.\\

The mezzanine's lateral walls are occupied by a pair of identical cells: the large, cloister-type lined by triple-stacked rows of bunkbeds. All occupants appear to be either dead or mad. One corpse has collapsed against the bars, his body held upright by the rigor mortis in his hands. On his chest, the sight of the Sign causes you to reflexively touch your own. Did they really manage to hunt down all of you?\\
