You flip through the keyring until you find a winner. The cell door gives a shrill, little shriek--and you pause, watching for any signs of aggression amongst the occupants. Nothing. You make your way inside with cautious, plodding steps.\\

Those hollows that yet cling to life watch you pass with dead-eyed interest, occasionally offering a whimper or the fragment of some half-formed thought. At the back of the cell, one odd figure catches your interest: the guard sitting against a bunkbed. He is rocking to and fro, striking the back of his head rhythmically against a bedpost. A burnt torch has been left discarded by his side.\\

On closer inspection, the guard still has a shortsword sheathed in his scabbard. That would make quite the addition to your arsenal. But drawing the blade poses a significant risk: if you were to cause a commotion, the entire cell might soon descend upon you.\\
