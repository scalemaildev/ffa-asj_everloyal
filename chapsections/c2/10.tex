You step into an armory. Unfortunately, most of its armaments have already been carried off.\\
\notegain{c210a} The armory door is unlocked\\

The dust-laden racks that line its walls are home to only a single, remaining spear. A closer look at the weapon soon reveals why it was left behind.\\
\gain{Warped Spear}\\

A battered kite shield has been discarded against the far wall in a similar fashion. Its crest: a white tower on a gray field, is barely visible beneath the many clefts and scratches.\\
\gain{Battered Kite Shield}\\

A few cabinets hold leather chest pieces and iron helmets in preparation for riots. In what seems to be a recurring pattern, only the most unwanted equipment remains.\\
\gain{Damaged Riot Armor}\\

One additional cabinet has been left closed. Its doors wonâ€™t budge, and thereâ€™s no keyhole either.\\

The armory is bordered by two sturdy doors, both secured with iron crossbars. One was built flush to the wall with no handle; it will not open from this side. The other leads to a crumbling walkway shrouded by fog.\\
