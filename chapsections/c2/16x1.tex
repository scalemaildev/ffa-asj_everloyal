The long-haired man claps his hands together when you produce the keychain. And he throws the cell door open as soon as the lock clicks.\\
\notegain{c216a} The cellmates are rescued\\

“Lor. Vagabond Lor.”\\
He sweeps a hand through his dirty locks, matting them into place.\\

“And I’m Professor Petanti--or Sinecure Petanti to the uneducated.”\\
He shoots Lor a look.\\

“Pleased to, um, make your acquaintance.”\\

“We locked ourselves in when the fog came. Was starting to think that’d be our tomb. You’re a real savior, you know that? Hah ha.”\\

Petanti rubs his hands idly.\\
“Did you, um, find any others? That survived this curse--the Malediction? Besides that rat-thing, I mean. I’m sure there’s more of us. Probably?”\\

“There must be. We’ll find them, then escape together.”\\

“And, um, go where?”\\

“Back to Gran Selidore, of course. We mustn’t forget...”\\

Vagabond Lor touches his Sign.\\
