As you approach the cell, the chittering stops. Peering through its slit window, you discover something small and furred quivering against the far wall.\\

You take a step back just before a ceramic shard juts violently through the window.\\

The makeshift weapon retracts, and a pair of beady red eyes peer out in its stead.\\
“Hmm-hmm? You no gobblegore. You no snickersnee. You O.”\\

The thing’s gnarled hand traces a circle behind the window.\\
“You O-friend. Me ratfriend. Ratfriend Niki. Very trust. Hee hee!”\\

A black-nailed finger pokes out from the slit, and points to a keyhole that’s been filled-in with mortar.\\
“Look, look. No clinkykey.”\\

“No key? No need. Chew-hole. In here. Went out. No good. Saw seeglass. Need smash-smash.”\\

Ratfriend Niki sticks its little hand through the window and gestures for something.\\
“Give smash-smash. Very trust. Hee hee!”\\
