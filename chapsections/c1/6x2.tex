You enter a room dedicated to a rope and pulley contraption. The rope’s free end is tied off on a pair of manacles. A cursory examination of your wrists reveals that you’ve experienced the strappado at least once during your confinement. Its dust-covered worktable is sadly bereft of any instruments that might be turned against your captors.\\

A stiff draft passes through the room’s broken window--your Ratfriend’s entrance. It gives you your first recent look at the outside world... or would, were it not completely obscured by fog. You stick your head out, and take a futile look around. All you can tell for certain is that you are very high up.\\

Stepping back over the shards of glass carefully with your bare feet, you happen to notice something on the floor.\\
