You enter a room dedicated to a rope and pulley contraption. The rope’s free end is tied off on a pair of manacles. A cursory examination of your wrists reveals that you’ve experienced the strappado at least once during your confinement. Its dust-covered worktable is sadly bereft of any instruments that might be turned against your captors.\\

A latch window gives you your first recent look at the outside world... or would, were it not completely obscured by fog. You open the latch, and take a futile look around. All you can tell for certain is that you are very high up.\\

Someone left a coin on this windowsill. Lucky copper?\\
