It’s only a short trip down the stairwell before you run into your Ratfriend again. It stands facing a strange sight indeed: a sheet of solid fog. It fills the archway of the landing with unnerving perfection, as if some mad mason had run out of stones and so repurposed the air itself to complete his work.\\

You approach the fog wall, arm outstretched, and its wispy tendrils seem to react to your presence... reaching out to you in kind. Your Ratfriend gives a shout, and you pull your arm back.\\

“No. Bad. No.”\\
It shakes its head rapidly, as if chasing rain from its fur.\\

Ratfriend beckons you over to the next flight of stairs--or what was once stairs. Its soffit has suffered a total collapse, obstructing the landing below. Ratfriend manages to squirm its way down through the rubble, and peers up at you from the other side. It doesn’t take much reckoning to determine that you won’t be capable of following. Despite its animal appearance, the guilt on your Ratfriend’s face is all too apparent.\\

“Thank-yoo, O-friend. Very trust.”\\

“Take sippy?”\\
It rifles through its rags, and produces something surprising: a sunlit flask. Quite the treasure to smuggle into such a place--this ‘sippy’--let alone keep it hidden from the guards. It heaves the flask up through the rubble with a two-handed lob, landing it in your hands.\\

“Sippy.”\\
It mimics a drinking motion, rubbing its furred belly.\\

“Come-come. Down.”\\
And with that, your Ratfriend is gone.\\

Behind you, the fog wall billows in menacing invitation--as if it were taunting you with your lone means of progress. Whatever it was that scared Ratfriend off, you’ll have to face the threat down by yourself if you’re to escape from this place.\\
