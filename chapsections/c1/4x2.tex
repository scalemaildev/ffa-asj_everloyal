Ratfriend Niki yanks on the rusted bars a few times, then pokes its nose past them.\\

“Stickstuck? Hmm-hmm.”\\

Niki tests the gap’s width again with its snout. And though it’s barely wide enough to accomodate one of your shoulders, your new ratfriend soon begins to wriggle its way through. First an arm, then its torso--little legs all a-kicking--until the critter manages to land on the other side.\\

You hear a labored grunt, and then the sound of something slowly wheeling into place. When Niki finally wrestles one of the doors open, you discover that they had been barred from the other side.\\

“Stickstuck. No clinkykey. Gobblegore. Hee... hee...”\\
\notegain{c14a} The large, iron-barred doors are open\\

Ratfriend Niki runs its tongue along its palms, and then rubs itself down. For a moment, it looks as if Niki might say something more--but then it turns and scampers down the stairs.\\

The way deeper into the prison shows signs of severe structural damage. Chunks of dislodged stone litter the stairwell. Through the aperture of the crumbling wall, you can catch glimpses of the complex’s exterior: in complete disrepair and choked by a thick fog.\\
