This stark, stone corridor has been your home for... you’re not entirely certain. A long time.\\

Its junction is bordered by three doors. The first: the jailer’s office, has been left open. The large, iron-barred doors in the center lead to the rest of the prison. You’re not sure where the third, green door goes. You don’t recall it ever opening--but then again you don’t recall much of anything.\\

At first glance, the other cells appear empty... save for a corpse or two. But then, from the far end of the corridor you hear an odd sound: chittering.\\
