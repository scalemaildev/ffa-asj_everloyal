\section{Scenario}
\emph{Everloyal} is the companion scenario to be released alongside the first edition of \emph{Fires Far Away: A Solitaire Journey}. It is intended to be a player’s first experience with the system. Owing to this, the scenario contains an initial, tutorial chapter for easing players into the system as a whole. Other scenarios aren’t likely to implement a tutorial chapter unless they have significantly altered the system’s mechanics.

\subsection{Scenario Setup}
Ensure the following game materials are available:

\begin{itemize}
\item The corebook
\item Pencil(s) and an eraser
\item At least 8 six-sided dice
\item A pack of index cards or scratch paper
\item A bowl of coins, beads, or other small and discrete tokens (for damage, charges, etc)
\item Printed copies of the character, status, and record sheets (found at the end of this scenario book)
\item 3 double-sided copies of the Hexagon-Tiled Map (found at the back of the corebook)
\item Optionally: the encounter reference sheet (found at the back of the corebook)
\end{itemize}

Then complete the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Gather 6 blank index cards
\item Mark each card with one of the following chapter symbols: a \textbf{circle}; a \textbf{skull}; a domed \textbf{tower}; two crossed \textbf{arrows}; an \textbf{owl}; and an \textbf{eye} with a slit pupil 
\item Set the \textbf{circle} and \textbf{skull} cards aside
\item Shuffle the remaining 4 cards facedown
\item Place the \textbf{circle} card atop the deck, facedown
\end{enumerate}

Afterwards, the chapter deck should consist of four cards in random order, with the \textbf{circle} card on top and the \textbf{skull} card set aside.
\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Note:} For this scenario, the \textbf{skull} chapter is not required to continue onto the \emph{prestige}.
\end{tcolorbox}
Once the game materials are gathered and the chapter deck is ready, it’s time to create a character.\\

\hyperlink{chargen}{\textbf{Turn to: Character Creation (Page \pageref{chargen}})}

\subsection{Scenario Resolution}
\label{scenres}\hypertarget{scenres}{}
After the character creation process is complete--and the character, record, and status sheets have been finalized-- begin drawing cards from the chapter deck and resolving their chapters.\\
To resolve a chapter, turn to its starting page (listed below). Continue through each chapter until the \textbf{End Chapter} instruction is encountered (either through victory over the chapter, or suffering a fatal defeat).\\
When the \textbf{End Chapter} instruction is encountered, erase all \emph{Ephemeral} items from the character sheet and stash. Next, clear any conditions and damage unless specifically instructed otherwise. Then erase any notes that are not bracketed by exclamation marks like: \emph{!!Note!!} Finally, draw the next chapter card and turn to its starting page.\\
After resolving the last card in the chapter deck, turn to the \emph{prestige’s} starting page for the scenario finale.\\
\ \\
\textbf{Chapter Starting Pages:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Circle:} \hyperlink{c11}{Page \pageref{c11}:c11}
\item \textbf{Tower:} N/A %\hyperlink{t11}{Page \pageref{t11}:t11}
\item \textbf{Arrows:} N/A %\hyperlink{a11}{Page \pageref{a11}:a11}
\item \textbf{Owl:} N/A %\hyperlink{o11}{Page \pageref{o11}:o11}
\item \textbf{Eye:} N/A %\hyperlink{e11}{Page \pageref{e11}:e11}
\item \textbf{Skull:} N/A %\hyperlink{s11}{Page \pageref{s11}:s11}
\item \textbf{\emph{Prestige:}} N/A %\hyperlink{pres}{Page \pageref{pres}}
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Note:} Do not start reading sequentially through this scenario book and spoil yourself.

\subsection{Scenario Concepts}
This section details gameplay concepts that are either unique to \emph{Everloyal} or have been significantly altered from the corebook. Reading this entire section is not necessary to begin play; simply reference these concepts as they’re encountered in-game.

\subsubsection{Chapters, Sections, and Readings}
Chapters are the main organizational unit of this scenario book. They refer to the six chapters of the game, each possessing its own chapter card. Every chapter has its own unique letter prepended to the codes of its readings and notes, i.e: \emph{c} for the \textbf{circle} chapter.\\
Chapters are broken into sections, which designate a general location within the chapter. The first number in the code for a reading designates its section, i.e: \emph{c1} for the first section of the \textbf{circle} chapter.\\
Readings are, as the name implies, the actual readings within a chapter. They are each designated by a code, prepended with its chapter and section serial, i.e: \emph{c11} for the first reading of the first section of the \textbf{circle} chapter.\\
Notes are named after the reading in which they are encountered, followed by a unique letter, i.e: \emph{c11a}.

\subsubsection{Conditions Roster}
\textbf{\emph{Cursed!:}} \hypertarget{Cursed!}{}\emph{Static.} Place the \textbf{skull} chapter card atop the chapter deck. The character immediately suffers a fatal defeat: \textbf{End Chapter.} The character loses all \refto{HMN} and souls, becomes Hollow, and cannot increase \refto{HMN} or upgrade \textbf{SL} while \reftoit{Cursed!} This condition can only be removed via a secret method (do not remove it while resolving \textbf{End Chapter}).\\

\textbf{Enhanced Defense:} \emph{Time-Limited - Round.} The entity’s specified \emph{sink} will increase by the listed amount while this condition is in effect.\\
The instructions for the enhanced \emph{sink} will look like: \textbf{P.DEF} (2), \textbf{F.DEF} (3), etc.\\
Try not to mistake the number of condition tokens for the Defense increase.\\
This condition is non-cumulative for each discrete \emph{sink}. The character sheet may not stack the effects of multiple \textbf{Enhanced Defense} tokens for a single \emph{sink}, but may benefit from multiple tokens affecting different \emph{sinks}.

\textbf{Enhanced Weapon:} \emph{Time-Limited - Round.} For the player, they will be asked to specify an equipped weapon. Attacks made by the specified weapon will deal additional damage while this condition is in effect. The amount and type of additional damage will be dictated by the source of this condition.\\
For enemies, the enemy sheet will specify the damage amount, type, as well as which attacks are enhanced.\\
The instructions for damage amount and type will look like: Poison (2), Burn (3), etc.\\
Try not to mistake the number of condition tokens for the damage increase.\\
The original damage inflicted by the weapon/attack retains its original damage type.\\
This condition is non-cumulative; the character may only benefit from one \textbf{Enhanced Weapon} token at a time.\\

\textbf{Mantra:} \emph{Static.} When the character is repeating a holy mantra, they gain a Mantra token on their status sheet that provides the mantra’s benefits. The status sheet is limited to a single Mantra token, which is replaced if the character activates a different mantra or is afflicted with Mute.\\

\textbf{Mute:} \emph{Time-Limited - Round.} A Mute entity cannot use any magic attacks or attunements, except for Guts and Revelations. When the character is inflicted with Mute, remove any Mystic Keys’ Mantra token from the status sheet.

\subsubsection{Fellows \& Tradables}
Trade is still alive and well in the fog-choked environs of Gran Selidore. Those few fellows who retain their sanity also retain their desire for barter--perhaps it’s essential to the well-being of the soul.\\
Fellows will part with the items, equipment, and attunements they’ve collected in exchange for tradables. Tradables can be anything from sweets to actual currency, and a fellow’s dedicated page will list their desires along with their offers (see the Fellows section for details).\\
Tradables can be \emph{Carried} and stored in the stash like any other equipment. Due to their small size, they can also be equipped in a pouch slot--and some tradables can even be used. If a tradable is used, then it is consumed as if it were an \emph{Ephemeral} item that had run out of charges. Tradables may also be “stacked” in their pouch or \emph{Carried} slot--mark how many tradables are held like: x1, x2, etc.\\
Of course, fellows are mortals and might be parted from their goods without the need for bartering--including those possessions they aren’t willing to trade away. But this kind of villainous behavior often has dire ramifications.

\subsubsection{Humanity, Memory, \& Hollowing}
\hypertarget{HMN}{}\hypertarget{MEM}{}
In \emph{Everloyal}, Humanity functions as a measure of the character’s memory. The character may mark \refto{HMN} boxes with acquired Humanity in the same manner described in the corebook. However, only \refto{HMN} boxes whose accompanying \reftoit{memento} (\refto{MEM}) slot is filled-in may be assigned Humanity.\\
When the player is instructed to lose Humanity, erase a \refto{HMN} box. If no \refto{HMN} boxes are marked, then \emph{erase the character’s name} and circle all permanent notes. If the character gains Humanity without possessing a name, then write a new, unique name for them instead of marking a \refto{HMN} slot.\\
A character without a name is considered Hollow (see the corebook’s Conditions Roster for details). Being Hollow during some events and chapter actions may alter their outcome.

\subsubsection{\emph{Mementos}}
\hypertarget{mementos}{}\hypertarget{memento}{}
Whenever the character acquires a \reftoit{memento}, fill-in the \refto{MEM} slot below a \refto{HMN} box. Filling-in this slot allows the accompanying \refto{HMN} box to be assigned with Humanity.\\
If the character loses or destroys one of their \reftoit{mementos}, erase a \refto{MEM} slot. Erasing the \refto{MEM} slot will not empty the accompanying \refto{HMN} box, it only prevents it from being marked again until another \reftoit{memento} is acquired.

\subsubsection{Names}
In \emph{Everloyal}, the character can forget their name by going Hollow. During hollowing, the player is instructed to erase their character’s name and circle all permanent notes. The circling of permanent notes designates them as experiences from a previous name. Some note checks might have further instructions depending on whether the character encountered them under a different name.\\
If a note check is bracketed like: \emph{(Note 123a)}, then the check requires that the note is \emph{not} circled.
