\section{Fellows}
To barter with a fellow, the character may exchange tradables for offers. Each offer has a cost corresponding to the value of that fellow’s desired tradables. The player must erase tradables from their character sheet equal to (or in excess of) the total value of the desired offer(s). Any excess value from erased tradables will be lost.

\subsubsection*{Offer Anatomy}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Offer:} The item, attunement, or service for sale
\item \textbf{Cost:} The threshold that must be met or exceeded by the value of the character’s tradables
\item \textbf{Effect:} A gain chapter action for the item or attunement, or a page to turn to for offers of service
\end{itemize}
