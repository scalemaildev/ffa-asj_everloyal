\section{Fellows}
To barter with a fellow, the character may exchange tradables for offers. Each offer has a cost listed in ‘points’ corresponding to the value of desired tradables. The player must erase tradables from their character sheet equal to (or in excess of) the total value of their desired offer(s). Any excess value from erased tradables will be lost.

\subsubsection*{Offer Anatomy}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Offer:} The item, attunement, or service for sale
\item \textbf{Cost:} The threshold that must be met or exceeded by the value of the character’s tradables
\item \textbf{Effect:} The page number listing the item or attunement, or a page to turn to for offers of service
\end{itemize}
