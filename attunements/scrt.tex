\subsection{Mystic Keys}
Something of a mania amongst the followers of Av*rn-Z*l, the Mystic Keys is a collection of secret words, mantras, and parables that produce miraculous effects when spoken--so long as the speaker is sufficiently convinced of their truthfulness. The Keys (as it’s often called in short) is an unwritten codex, and King Z*l’s faithful are forbidden from translating any of its contents into writing upon pain of death. Despite this, there is still some iconography within the religion, the most popular of which being the Sign: a thin, hollow circle representing loyalty.
