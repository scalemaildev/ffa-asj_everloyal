\subsection{Revelations}
The worship of Av*rn-Z*l is already an occult religion, yet it still manages to retain its own sect of gnostics--a secretive cult within a secretive cult. These gnostics contemplate the Mystic Keys in search of Revelations: alternative meanings behind its words and parables. These profane meanings pervert the power of the Keys, producing verso-miracles. Revelations are also thought, not spoken; and this suspicious silence only lends to their dark reputation. The practice of Revelations has long been branded as blasphemy by the Inner Circle, and has led to burnings and even internally-led pogroms.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Catalyst:} Icons (Optionally)
\item \textbf{Bonus:} \textbf{DB}
\item \textbf{Notes:} Each Revelations attunement is derived from an identical entry in the Secrets roster. Attuning an entry from Secrets also gives the character access to its twin in the Revelations roster. The character must still meet any requirements for the version they wish to activate. In-game, the character will only encounter these attunements via their entry in the Secrets roster
