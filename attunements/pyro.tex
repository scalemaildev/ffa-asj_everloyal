\subsection{Pyromancy}
Pyromancy is a simple but dangerous hedge magic that focuses on nurturing an Eternal Ember into great conflagrations. It requires little skill, but a great amount of concentration--and can be extremely hazardous in the hands of the inept. This magic is semi-religious in nature, and canonically stems from an unnamed demigod known as the Thief of Fire.
